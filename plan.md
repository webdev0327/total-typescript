Type hierarchy - sets of types. Where should I introduce it? Unions, probably.

Don't use Function, Object, String etc

never disappearing in unions

`Exclude<string, 'hello'>` doesn't work.

Add Exclude/Extract to deriving types from values

JSDoc section?
Setters in classes?
Add decorators when they're supported in vite

Non null assertion

Add 'any' diagram

Import/export type

`__dirname` not usable in ESM
