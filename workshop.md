## Exercises

- We'll be in pairs all day
- Each section, someone codes, someone else looks up docs
- Swap over who is coding each section
- If you get stuck, you can ask me for help

VSCode is recommended, but not necessary

## Setup

1. `pnpm` must be installed
2. Repo must be cloned locally
3. Turn off GitHub Copilot
4. Pull the latest changes
5. Make sure you've selected your TypeScript version to be the one used by the repo (latest)

## Repo overview

- Exercises are in `src`
- Run each exercise with `pnpm exercise` or `pnpm e`
- Explainers vs Problem/Solution files
- There is WAY TOO MUCH CONTENT
- Look in the `workshop.md` files

## Final Questions

### What's the difference between types and interfaces?

### TypeScript has "open object types". What does that mean?

### What new piece of syntax did you learn about?

### What did you learn that you can immediately apply on a project?

### Did you end up liking TypeScript more, or wishing you could go back to JavaScript?
