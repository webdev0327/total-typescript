## Repo overview

- Exercises are in `src`
- Run each exercise with `pnpm exercise` or `pnpm e`
- Explainers vs Problem/Solution files
- There is WAY TOO MUCH CONTENT
- Look in the `workshop.md` files

## Exercises

- We'll be in pairs all day
- Each section, someone codes, someone else looks up docs
- Swap over who is coding each section
- If you get stuck, you can ask me for help

## Any Questions?

## Setup

1. `pnpm` must be installed
2. Repo must be cloned locally
3. Turn off GitHub Copilot
4. Pull the latest changes
5. Make sure you've selected your TypeScript version to be the one used by the repo (latest)

VSCode is recommended, but not necessary
